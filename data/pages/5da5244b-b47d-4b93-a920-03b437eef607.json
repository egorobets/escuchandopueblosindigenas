In the interview, she reflects on how 500 years of colonialism have meant ongoing marginalization, exploitation, and discrimination against Indigenous peoples, while also emphasizing their enduring cultural strength and collective resistance. In the video below, you will learn about her personal vision of Indigenous struggles past and present, the deep connection to land and memory that defines many Indigenous movements, and why she sees hope in shared efforts for justice, dignity, and a future shaped by Indigenous voices."
